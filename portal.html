<h2>The Portal</h2>

<div class="portal-box">

    <p>
        The portal is a dimensional gateway that connects two worlds:
        <span class="highlight">Earthland</span> and
        <span class="highlight">Magica</span>.
        It was created as the result of a powerful spell gone wrong,
        tearing a permanent opening between realities.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
        Over time, the instability of the portal allows creatures such as
        ghouls, spirits, ghosts, vampires, and werewolves to cross into
        Earthland. Their presence disrupts the natural balance of both worlds.
    </p>

    <p>
        In response, mages and knights from Magica enter Earthland through the
        same gateway to either vanquish these creatures or return them to their
        rightful realm.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
        Visually, the portal appears as an ancient wooden door suspended in space.
        Its surface is engraved with delicate
        <span class="highlight">forget-me-not flowers</span>,
        faintly glowing when the boundary between worlds weakens.
    </p>
